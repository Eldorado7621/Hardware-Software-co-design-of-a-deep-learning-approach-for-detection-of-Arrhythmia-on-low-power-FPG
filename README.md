# Hardware-Software-co-design-of-a-deep-learning-approach-for-detection-of-Arrhythmia-on-low-power-FPGA

# Overview
In this project is on hardware/software co-design of a deep learning approach for fast detection of Arrhytmia on low power and low resource embedded FPGA device. In simpler terms, the project is about coming up with a low resource device that would detect abnormal heart rates at a fast rate and low power consumption.

# Motivation and Description

According to WHO, cardiovascular diseases are the world leading cause of death in the world-claiming about 17.9 million lives every year. [1](https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases#tab=tab_1)
As such being able to detect abnormalities early enough before it becomes extremely dangerous have the potential of saving a lot of lives. 
In this project, we explored the possibility of designing custom hardware acceleration (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) that would be employ Artificial Intelligence in detecting abnormalities in heart rate- it would significantly improve the speed of detection while keeping the power consumption low .
